1.	For my final project I will create a game inspire by "Flappy Bird" called "Flappy Plane". The game objective is to collect many candy as you can while avoid hitting the penguin. The user can use spacebar, left mouseclick or touchscreen to make the plane go up.  
2.	Implementation:
  a.	Week 1: create camera, lights, scene and the renderer
  b.	Week 2: Loading the plane, change the camera position and make it follow the plane, make the plane wobble.
  c.	Week 3: Add user input. User can press spacebar, mouse click or touch screen to keep the plane up. Add score and lives to the game. 
  d.	Week 4: loading penguin model and the candy model. Make every colummn has only one candy and 6 pengiun. The candy will alway be in the middle of the column. Spawn the 3 columns of the obstacle at the time and space them accordingly. Update the lives and scores. The player will lose thier lives if they hit the penguin and they will get score if they hit the candy.
  e.	Week 5: Add explosion effect. Add sound effects.
3.	I will be using THREE.js
