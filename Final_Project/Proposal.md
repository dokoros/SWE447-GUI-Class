1.	For my final project I will create a Rubik’s Cube that the user can interacting with. The Rubik’s Cube will render realistically with light source and texture. 
2.	Implementation:
  a.	Week 1: create cubes and put them in the correct place in space to create one Rubik’s Cube
  b.	Week 2: Implement light source into the scene 
  c.	Week 3: find out how to put the cube into row and column so they can rotate either horizontally or vertically accordingly to their row or column.
  d.	Week 4: Add user interaction with the cube. They first need to click either row or column and then they can rotate them by using the arrow keys. The user can also right click on the Rubik’s Cube and spin the cube around
  e.	Week 5: User can also rotate the camera, added auto scramble for the Rubik’s Cube.
3.	I will be using THREE.js
